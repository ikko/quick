In the context of Microsoft SQL Server, **CTE** stands for **Common Table Expression**. It is a temporary result set that is defined within the execution scope of a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement. A CTE simplifies complex queries by allowing you to break them down into smaller, more manageable parts and refer to the CTE multiple times within the same query.

### Key Features of CTEs in SQL Server:
1. **Temporary and Reusable**: A CTE exists only during the execution of the query and can be referred to multiple times within the query.
2. **Readable and Maintainable**: It improves the readability of complex queries, especially for recursive queries.
3. **Recursion**: CTEs are particularly useful for writing recursive queries, like hierarchies (e.g., organizational charts or file systems).
4. **No Need for a Temporary Table**: Unlike a derived table or a subquery, a CTE doesn’t require creating a temporary table in the database.

### Syntax of a CTE:
```sql
WITH CTE_Name AS (
    -- CTE query
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
)
-- Main query using the CTE
SELECT *
FROM CTE_Name;
```

### Example of a Basic CTE:
```sql
WITH EmployeeCTE AS (
    SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
    FROM Employees
    WHERE Department = 'HR'
)
SELECT * FROM EmployeeCTE;
```

### Example of a Recursive CTE:
A recursive CTE is useful for hierarchical data, like finding employees' managers in an organization.

```sql
WITH RecursiveCTE AS (
    SELECT EmployeeID, ManagerID, FirstName, LastName
    FROM Employees
    WHERE ManagerID IS NULL  -- Start with the top-level managers

    UNION ALL

    SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.ManagerID, e.FirstName, e.LastName
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN RecursiveCTE r ON e.ManagerID = r.EmployeeID
)
SELECT * FROM RecursiveCTE;
```

### Key Considerations:
- **Performance**: Although CTEs improve readability, in some cases, they can result in less optimized execution plans compared to using subqueries or temporary tables.
- **Scope**: The CTE is only valid within the query where it’s defined, so it cannot be reused across multiple queries unless defined again.

In summary, a CTE is a powerful feature in SQL Server that enhances query organization, makes complex queries easier to manage, and supports recursive queries for hierarchical data.
